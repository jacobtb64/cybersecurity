encoding: used ti transform data so it can be properly used by different type of system
Not used to keep info secret
data is encoded with publically-available schemes that can be decoed by anyone

8 bits in a byte

binary

ASCII is used to rep computer stored characters in a humane readable format

binary data can be more efficiently stored and represented by encoding with the hexadecimal number system
the hex system uses 16 symbols to rep the base values

data in motion:data moving between devices
data at rest: static,

authentication: even when a message is encrypted, an attacker can still send encrypted
 
integrit

P.A.I.N:
P: keeps data secure
A:
I: enusres a message isn't altered between when its sent and when its received
N: non-repudiation prevents the

stream ciphers: apply their algorithm one bit (character) at a time
block ciphers: apply their algorithm to chunks of characters

Key space: each algorith has a possible range of numbers that can be used as a key

key space=2 bs (bit size)

symmetric key algorithms use a single, shared key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
this shared key needs to remain PRIVATE. if exposed, the message can be decypted by anyone

DES is a 56-bit key published by the usa government in 1977
flaws 

NIST: the national institiute of standards and technology
nist opened a contest for cryptographers

in 1997 the NIST announced they were seeking a replacement for DES

Disadvantage one: Key exchange: as more individuals are included in the key exchange, there needs to be a key for each combination of individuals
each individual has a public key and a private key (never show private key)

you need to have the private key to decrypte a message using the same person/buisness public key

while symmetric key counts grows exponentially larger as the number of employees increase, asymmetric count stays proportionate and managable

GPG is a command-line tool used to simplify the creation, encryption,

gpg --armor --output julie.gpg --export

gpg --armor --output <bankinfo-safe.txt> --encrypt --recipient <file name>

hashing is a cryptographic method used to verify the intefrity of data. similar to encryptiom, hashing

encryption takes a plaintect and converts it to ciphertext with a key and an algorithm

encryption con

hashing algorithms output FIXED LENGTHS, regardless of the input length, the output length is always the same.
if a small change is made to the input of a hashing algorithm, the message digest is completely different.

hashing has several algorithms
SHA: stands for secure hashing algorithms, and includes its successors, sha1 and sha2
SHA 2: has variations with different security

digital signatures
a digital

other digital signatures include
1 all at once: a signature appended to an encrypted message
2 clearsigned: a signature appended to an unencrypted message
3 signed hash instead of signing a message, a hash is created first

xdg-open <file> opens from terminal

encryption can be used to secure portable devices like laptops abd cell phones. most current 
bitloacker: microsoft windows uses a symmetric disk encryption program
FileVault: macs use a symmetric disk program

emails are not natively encrypted. they are sent and recieved in plaintext.

public key cryptography can be ised to secure websites
secure socket layer (ssl): is a protocol designed to encrypt web traffic
websites use ssl
