MAC firewalls operate on layer 2 of the OSI and filter based on source and destination MAC addresses
routers compare the MAC address of a device against an approved list if there is a match, the traffic is forwarded to that device
stateless packet-filtering firewalls operate between layer 3 and layer 4


runtime config
valid until next system reboot
can be used to test new configs

network firewall on plus individual ones



sudo so-reply

ids (intrusion detection system. both analyzes traffic and looks for malicious signatures

and ids is like a firewall that read the data in the packets it inspects, issues alerts, and blocks malicious traffic (if configured to do so)

network security monitoring (NSM) is the process of iding weaknessess in a networks defense.
it also provides 

ids detects and alerts of an attack
ids are passive. they do not respond to attacks, they only log and document info for future analyzation

network intrusion detection (NIDS): filters an entire subnet on a network
Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) runs locally


network intrusion detection filters an entire subnet on a network:
matches all traffic to a known library of attack signatures
passively examines 


host-based intrusion detection runs locally on a host


itrusion prevention system (IPS)

IDS connects via a network tap or mirrored SPAN port

IPS connects inline with the flow of data, typically between the firewall and network switch

IDS alerts: an alert is a message that is sent to an analysts console as an indicator of attack (IOA)
an ids system generates alerts when a snort rule detects malicious traffic that matches a signature
are generally placed at strategic points in a network where traffic is most vulnerable

indicator of attack (IOA): indicators of attack indicate attacks happening in real time
indicator of compromise (IOC): indicators of compromise indicate previous malicious activity

SNORT: 
network security monitoring (NSM) is the process of iding weaknesses

NSM operates in two stages, each involving

Malware cannot activate in the encrypted state.

ossec agents are deployed to hosts and collect syslog data
this data generates alerts that are sent to the centralized server.

ossec monitors syslog data, but security admins use 3 other important tools to fully analyze packet captures
